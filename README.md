- VODKA: Virtualization Obfuscation using Dynamic Key Approach <strong>WISA 2018</strong><br>
  **Author: Jaeyung Lee, Jaehyuk Suk, Donghoon Lee**<br>
  The virtualization obfuscation technique is known to possess excellent security among software protection techniques. However, research has shown that virtualization obfuscation techniques can be analyzed by automated analysis tools because the deobfuscate virtualization obfuscation methodology is fixed. In this situation, additional protection techniques of the virtualization structure have been studied to supplement the protection strength of virtualization obfuscation. However, most of the proposed protection schemes require a special assumption or significantly increase the overhead of the program to be protected.<br>
  In this paper, we propose a delayed analysis method for a lightweight virtualization structure that does not require a strong assumption. Hence, we propose a new virtual code protection scheme combining an anti-analysis technique and dynamic key, and explain its mechanism. This causes correspondence ambiguity between the virtual code and the handler code, thus causing analysis delay. In addition, we show the result of debugging or dynamic instrumentation experiment when the additional anti-analysis technique is applied.

- Unthemida: Commercial Obfuscation Technique Analysis with Fully Obfuscated Program <strong>Software-Practice and Experience, 2018</strong>
  **Author: Jaehyuk Suk, Jaeyung Lee, Hongjoo Jin, In Seok Kim, Donghoon Lee**<br>
  The main goal of code obfuscation is to make software more difficult to reverseengineer. These techniques modify data structures and control flow while retain-ing the functionality of the original program. Although obfuscation is a usefulmethod for protecting programs, it can also be used to protect malware. Thisraises concerns that malware could use code obfuscation to avoid detection byantivirus software. It is very difficult to analyze the functionality of obfuscatedmalware before it has been deobfuscated. Furthermore, commercial obfuscationtools allow malware authors to apply multiple obfuscation options simultane-ously, and current deobfuscation techniques cannot handle this situation. In thisstudy, we analyzed a well-known commercial obfuscation tool called Themida.We applied its many obfuscation options to a program and implemented a toolto recover the original code and data. We extracted features from obfuscated pro-grams and analyzed their control flow. Our tool is based on these features and thecontrol flow patterns and can identify whether Themida has been applied to theprogram and which obfuscation options have been used. Finally, we suggesteda method for recovering the import address table of programs by using dynamicbinary instrumentation. The proposed rules and algorithms can almost com-pletely recover the APIs of programs even though they are hidden by obfuscationoptions provided by Themida.
